### Path of Challenges: The Path of Exile Synthesis Challenge League Helper and Guide


## Hello and Welcome to Path of Challenges!
Path of Challenges is a application that is designed to help Path of Exile players complete and track league challenges.
In the future I plan on adding more functionality and features, but at the moment it is mainly a guide that lists all the synthesis league challenges as well as tips and links on how to complete them.

## Features
Path of Challenges has an accordian table which is populated by all 40 Synthesis league challenges, detailing their Title, Description, Objectives, Tips on how to complete them and any helpful links to guides, videos, trades or gamepedia pages.

## Future plans
* Further increase the ease of viewing, tracking and access for all the challenges
* Implement Challenge editing, loading and saving features so users can create their own personal challenges for things such as private leagues or challenges between friends
* Improve layout of Path of Challenges, while also adding in themes / user customisation.

## Download
You can visit the [Releases](https://github.com/LeightonJonker/Path-of-Challenges/releases) page to see the lastest version of Path of Challenges!

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Grinding Gear Games for creating Path of Exile, as well as the talented folks at Poelab.com, Engineering Eternity and ZiggyD as they have many great guides for Path of Exile which I have referenced in this application. the Path of Exile gamepedia pages have also been a great help in helping teach and show exiles the different mechanics in Path of Exile.

## Please Note
I developed Path of Challenges on Windows 10, so I am currently unsure if the application works with Linux or Mac. Sorry for any inconvenience!
