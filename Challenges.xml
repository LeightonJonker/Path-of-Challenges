       <tips> This challenge is quite reliant on RNG, as these monsters can only appear in memory fragments and in memories. Running as many memory fragments and making long synthesis chains will help complete this 
       challenge. Try to make long connecting chains of memories and applying as many global modifiers as possible, as there are global modifers that upgrade mob packs to rare and add more pack size to memories,
       increasing the chance that you will find the monsters you need to kill. The link provided is a ZiggyD video of how to make long memory chains. </tips>

       <tips> Making maps rare or magic will give them modifiers that give more rewards and experience at the expense of being harder to complete. The Twinned modifier in this case doubles the number of unique
         bosses found in the map. An easy way to achieve this challenge is to either alchemy these maps and hope you get a "Twinned" modifier or use Transmutation, Augmentation and Alteration orbs
         to make a magic map with the Twinned modifer. You can also buy the maps with the modifer or tag along with someone else who is going to run the map.</tips>

       <tips> While progressing through end-game maps and completing Shaper influenced maps, the Elder will appear on the Atlas, spreading his influence. To fight the Elder Guardians, you must complete
       maps that have the shapers influence that are adjacent to elder influenced maps. This will cause the Shaper to be pushed back and the Elder influence to grow. Once approximately
       15 maps have been taken over by the Elder, random Elder-Influenced maps will allow the Elder Guardians to spawn in the stead of the normal unique bosses in those maps.
       Once all 4 Elder Guardians have been defeated the Elder himself becomes able to be fought. The Poelab link provided is a guide on how to defeat the elder, and has a guide for each of the guardians on the website as well.</tips>

        <objectives> Defeat Fragment of Winter (T8 Waterways Map) while at least 10 summoned Volatile Ice are alive. </objectives>
       <tips>These encounters are from bosses in the end-game mapping system. These encounters either require a very fast kill of the boss, or to wait until certain conditions are met
       before the boss can be killed. 
       For Doedre, She will start screaming a little while after you start fighting her, forcing you to hide behind rocks found in the room as the scream does quite a bit of damage. If you have enough defences and damage you will be able to tank her scream and kill her before it kills you. 
       For the Guardian of the Vault, each time he slams down he will summon a guardian. Stay within the Guardian's protective bubble without attacking it and wait for 4 animated guardians to have been summoned and defeated before you defeat the Guardian of the Vault. 
       The Canyon Map has 2 bosses, Stonebeak and Gnar; having a build with enough damage to kill them while they are close together will complete this part of the challenge.
       The Fragment of Winter will periodically spawn Volatile Ice monsters, which must not be attacked. Leaving the area, returning and staying invulnerable (not moving) once the boss is aggressive towards you or your golem will cause it to periodically spawn more Volatile Ice. Once 10 have been created you can kill the boss. Usually a low area of effect single target skill is most suited for this challenge.

       <tips> These are the boss memories of the Memory Nexus. First they must appear (which they start to after Cavas regains his memory). They must then be pathed to using memories and completed.
       The bosses themselves are not too difficult if they are in lower level areas but a character which can kite and safely attack the bosses from range (such as a trapper or totem-user) is reccomended.
       An easy way to spawn the Synthesis bosses is to not complete any reward nodes so that the limit of 19 is reached. The 20th node to spawn will always be a boss node. You can force a "tick" of the memory nexus
       by placing and spawning a memory, so it is advised to have one of your Nexus' bridges free so you can repeatedly spawn and delete memories to force bosses to spawn.   </tips>

        maps and hoping to come across the fragmented memories you need. It seems that fragmented memories are not area / map specific as well so any area can give any memory. </tips>

        <objectives> Kill a monster with five Essences in an area level of 80 or higher. (Completed by using a Remnant of Corruption on a Essence monster with 4 essences, making it 5) </objectives>
       <tips> These challenges (especially the first 3) are in the most parts, DPS and maneuverability checks.
       With the Shaper, your best bet is to be able to deal enough damage to move him into his next state before any Anomalies can even spawn. If any do spawn, they are relatively slow moving and should be easy to kite, while making the fight a little harder. 
       The Vessels of the Vaal will need to be both brought down to low health before they are killed as they both have quite a lot of health in the Alluring Abyss. 
       The Mastermind of the Syndicate is the hardest as the area level must be 80 and above and the Volatile Skeletons are quite troublesome to evade, given the space you get to move around in the Mastermind fight.
       Using the Essence Zana map mod (3c) will increase the chances of finding a natural 4 essence creature which you can then use a Remnant of Corruption on to make it 5 essences. </tips>

        <objectives> Defeat Rewritten Synthete without taking damage from Summoned Stationary Pylons. </objectives>
       <tips> An extension of Complete Distant Memories I, this challenge requires a level area of 75 and above. The Synthesis bosses will, during the fight with them, spawn entities that do not move but deal damage to whoever touches them or their projectiles.
       The easiest way to complete this challenge would be to use a character that is able to focus on moving around the Filimites / Pylons with high speed (such as a Trapper, Totem user, Winter Orb User or Brand User.).
       These bosses do not have any invincibility phases, meaning charaters with high DPS can defeat the bosses without spawning the Filimites or Pylons. Running Tier 8 maps will ensure that the boss spawned is level 75. A level 75 boss has the lowest life and is the easiest to defeat. 
       An easy way to spawn the Synthesis bosses is to not complete any reward nodes so that the limit of 19 is reached. The 20th node to spawn will always be a boss node. You can force a "tick" of the memory nexus by placing and spawning a memory, so it is advised to have one of your Nexus' bridges free so you can repeatedly spawn and delete memories to force bosses to spawn. </tips>

You can force a "tick" of the memory nexus by placing and spawning a memory, so it is advised to have one of your Nexus' bridges free so you can repeatedly spawn and delete memories to force bosses to spawn.   </tips>

       <tips> Red tier maps are maps that are tiers 11 and on. The only way to get 8 mods on a map is via a Vaal Orb. 8 mod maps can be bought from other exiles or run in rotations (everyone in a party has their own map and take turns running them) I have provided a link for a trade search of red tier 8 mod maps. Don't forget to change your league to what you are playing in!</tips>

       <tips> Most unique maps are quite cheap and purchaseable from other exiles, with some more expensive ones such as Perandus Manor and The Putrid Cloister should either be skipped or paid to complete by people offering completions in global. 
       The Divination card "The Encroaching Darkness" also gives unique maps but has had it's drop rate nerfed in recent patches.
       Using the pathofexile.com/trade API you can easily search for all these maps and see which ones are affordable to run. </tips>

        <objectives> Complete the Beachhead (Harbinger Map) </objectives>
       <tips> 
       The Bestiary boss portal can be spawned by certain captured red beasts, which can be bought from players or found in maps (Saqawine Rhex, Craicic Spider Crab, Fenumal Hybrid Arachnid and Farric Tiger Alpha).
       Cadiro Perandus can only be spawned in the Research Safehouse when Janus is in the Research branch OR in the Perandus Manor map, which is very expensive (so it is suggested you run Janus in Research). 
       The Vaal omnitect is probably the easiest as it appears often due to the incursion league mechanic and only needs to be level 75 (Tier 8 maps) or higher.
       The Beachhead is usually quite expensive as it gives decent experience and it's advised that you buy a spot from other exiles running the map. </tips>

       Poelab.com and the Youtube channel Engineering Eternity provide great guides to defeating Atziri, the Delve bosses and The Shaper.
       The link I have provided is for Vaal Temples which is a tier 16 map which can only be obtained from divination cards or by using a Vaal orb on a tier 15 map.  </tips>

       <Description >Complete the entire questline given by Zana. </Description> 
       <numobj> 0 </numobj>
       <tips>Zana's questline is about defeating Uber Elder which is PoE's current endgame boss. If your build is not top tier then try ask for an experienced player to kill it for you when you can spawn Uber Elder / The Shaper.
        To spawn Uber elder, you need to get all memory fragments, defeat The Shaper, then let the elder influence your higher tier maps. If you see a visible Shaper influence on the Shaper Guardians, defeat them and let the Elder influence take over.
        Occupying each of the Shaper Guardians will end with the elder taking over the Atlas Symbol at the middle of your atlas. From then you can access the Uber Elder by using the Shaper's 4 Guardian fragments, which is the same way you access The Shaper's realm.
        The Uber Elder fight is the Shaper fight combined with the Elder fight, meaning you will need to fight the Shaper and the Elder at the same time. This is the somewhat final boss of the game and requires a lot of damage and maneuverability to beat. </tips>

       <tips> When you make a map magic or rare, it gains boosts to stats such as item rarity, monster pack size and item quantity. You need to run a very large amount of rare maps in order to complete this challenge.
        Using alchemy orbs on white maps to make them rare will usually give a very large boost to item quantity, while running unidentified maps will add an additional 30% item quantity to the map. Maps can drop 
        rare and unidentified or made unidentified when a vaal orb is used on them. Sacrifice fragments that drop from corrupted unique bosses and vaal side areas as well as mortal fragments that drop from queen Atziri can also be put in the map device for a 5% or 10% quantity boost respectively.  </tips>
